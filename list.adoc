List of tips to cover
=====================

. Shortcut: Ctrl-Shift-T & Ctrl-Shift-R
. Shortcut: Ctrl-Shift-T then CamelCase initials to find classes
. Refactoring: Extract method?
. Refactoring: Replacing ternary with if/else
. Typing: automatically place semicolons
. Typing: escape text when pasting into a string literal
. Do not always remember the shortcuts? Find any option with Ctrl-Shift-3
. Organize imports: how to ignore javadoc
. Formatter: don't touch my manually wrapped lines!
. Formatter: don't touch that part (using begin/end tags). link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/toulouse-jug/EFHt84uEkLk/-OoFV7dopNQJ[Thx Emmanuel Fontan])
. How to quick fix many issues outside of the Clean up menu https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351956
. Junit: add -ea to VM arguments... good way to enable this option but not globally when you 
  may be using libs that added a bunch of incorrect assertions
. Eclipse fav : static imports
. JSR305 annotations to help null analysis
. link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/M6/#JDT[JSR305 externally 
  annotated classes (Eclipse Mars)]
. Save actions: automatic formating
. Automatic contextualization inside an instanceof block (auto-add cast)
. Shortcut: [Ctrl]-alt-arrow up or down to copy or move lines
. Alt-Shift-x / T for the tests, ...
. Type filters (to filter out java.awt.* for example...)
. Type filter : filter out method coming from Object! (who wants to call notify...)
. _Exception variable name in catch blocks_
. Alt-Shift-A (link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/toulouse-jug/SpOWtYPxJa0/tGkr5LAbwU8J[thx Olivier Jaquemet]), as if Sublime invented it all :-)	
. Step filtering (thx Sebastien Bordes for the reminder) : be able to filter out stack when debugging (?) (to be tested)
. Filtering/choosing which methods to display in the _Outline_ using javadoc's _@category_ tags (thanks link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/toulouse-jug/EFHt84uEkLk/Wdf3VMMDM0YJ[Jordi Barr√®re]).
. Logical structure (way to present complex/weird data structure in a more logical that physical way).
