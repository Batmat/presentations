== Abreviate package name

In _Java/Appearance/abbreviate package names_ :

Example:

    net.batmat.econ2015={DEMO}

[cols="^,^"]
|====
| Before | After
a| image::pkg-abbreviation-before.png[]
a| image::pkg-abbreviation-after.png[]
|====

== Find any class by name

[role="shortcut tip"]
Control-Shift-T

== Browse current class methods

Ctrl-O displays all the methods of the current class

<<< 

Or Inherited

Ctrl-O-O methods of the current class + *parent*

== Find resources

[role="shortcut tip"]
Control-Shift-R

== Use CamelCase

image::camelcase-filtering.png[]

<<<

Or more selectively

image::camelcase-filtering-more-selective.png[]

Use space or < to stop matching

== Move/Copy lines up and down

:selectedtextdown: the currently selected lines down

* Alt-arrow-down to move {selectedtextdown}
* Ctrl-Alt-arrow-down to copy {selectedtextdown}

== Quick contextual execution menu

_Alt-Shift-x_ will display a contextual menu.

Example: you're in a JUnit class, just type Alt-Shift-X then T to run the tests.

image::alt-shift-x-menu.png[]

== Execute previous run instead of current open file

Be explicit. Changing the code it's natural to just run Ctrl-F11 or F11 to re-execute the previously ran test

Run/Debug/Launching/Launch Operation/Always launch the previously launched application

[[QuickFix]]
== Quick fix

Type _Ctrl-Shift-1_ (or click on the lightbulb on the left of the line) to see what the possible actions are on the current focus

image::quickfix.png[Quick Fix Example]

[[ExtractMethod]]
== Extract Method

Select text, right click and extract the whole code block into a new method easily.

Inverse: see <<InlineMethod>>

[[InlineMethod]]
== Inline Method

Easily inline the code of a method.

* Select method to inline/Right click/Refactor/Inline Method.
* Shortcut: Alt-Shift-I

Inverse: see <<ExtractMethod>>

== Refactoring: Replacing ternary with if-else

Replace your ternary expression with an if-else (more often than not!)

Before :

image::ternary-before.png[]

After :

image::ternary-after.png[]

== Invert if/else conditions

Select the if/else to invert, and call the <<QuickFix,Quick Fix>>

== Generate for-loop on collection

Just type the collection/array, and call the <<QuickFix,Quick Fix>>

TODO : check that OK/find right way to use it.

== Convert to lambda expression

Accessible through Clean Up & <<QuickFix,Quick Fix>>

== Typing: automatically place semicolons

== Typing: escape text when pasting into a string literal

Not enabled by default. In Java/Editor/Typing.

== Meta-Shortcut

Use _Ctrl-Shift-3_ on a selected item, then start typing to filter the possible actions in the _Quick access_ menu.

== Save actions: automatic formating

Useful: be able to automatically format only the code just modified when saving the file.

See in _Java/Editor/Save Actions/Format source code/Format edited lines_

[[formatterOnOff]]
== Formatter: don't touch that part (using begin/end tags)

[source,java]
----
// @formatter:off
     // Some weirdly formatted source
     String s2 = 
				            "hello";
// @formatter:on
----

== Tweak autocompletion (aka content assist)

Typing Ctrl-Space many times shows different proposals.

Those are actually configurable.

== Favorites

Autocomplete static imports!

In Java/Editor/Content Assist/Favorites

== JSR305 annotations to help null analysis

Lets you add more typesafe-ness in your codebase (at least way more than Javadoc does!).

Beware: it's not enforcing anything at all at runtime. This is only hints for the developer.

<<<

To go even further:

* link:http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html[The Checker Framework]



== Null analysis: one step further with Type Annotations (JSR 308)

[source]
----
@Nonnull List<@Nonnull String> list = new ArrayList<>();

for(String string : list) {
  if(string != null )	{ // Useless if hinted by Eclipse
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("WTF?");
  }
  ...
}
----


== JSR 305 externally defined annotations

New in Eclipse Mars, released yesterday! (24/03/2015).
link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/M6/#JDT[JSR305 externally annotated classes (Eclipse Mars)]
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=461300

TODO TODO TODO !


== Annotating the package itself

Advice: annotate the package itself to define the default value for a whole package

=> `package-info.java`

NOTE: With regards to _Null Analysis_ : because studies show developers actually expect parameters to be passed non null as a default, you will generally annotate the package with "Nonnull by default" and then only annotate methods where you actually expect or produce Nullable things.

== Overwrite end of method name instead of adding

Java/Editor/Content Assist : toggle "Completion overwrites" instead of "Completion Inserts"

Can be live toggled using _Ctrl_ key.

== Instanceof Automatic Contextualization

Inside an instanceof block, analyzes the type of the given instanceof and autocompletes with its methods:

image::autocast-instanceof.png[]

== Type filters

In Java/Appearance/Type Filters

To filter out java.awt.* for example...

<<<

Filter out method coming from Object! (who wants to call `notify()`...)

image::type-filters.png[]

== Filtering methods by categorizing them

Categorize Filtering/choosing which methods to display in the _Outline_ using javadoc's _@category_ tags 

[role="thanks"]
(thanks link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/toulouse-jug/EFHt84uEkLk/Wdf3VMMDM0YJ[Jordi Barrère]).

== Step filtering
 
Be able to filter out stack when debugging:

* By class
* Constructors
* Getters/setters
* ...

[role="thanks"]
(thx Sebastien Bordes for the reminder)

== Multi-line Edit

Alt-Shift-A or the icon, as if Sublime Text invented it all ;-)

[role="thanks"]
(link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/toulouse-jug/SpOWtYPxJa0/tGkr5LAbwU8J[Thanks Olivier Jaquemet])

== Logical structure

Present complex/weird physical data structure in a logical way in the debugger

For reference see the link:http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fpreferences%2Fjava%2Fdebug%2Fref-logical_structures.htm[official documentation]
or that link:http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t16736.html[forum discussion].

== Working Sets

Useful to categorize projects, or packages.

== Scrapbooking, REPL

[source,java]
String s = String.format("%05d", 7);
s

TODO : Faire sécher tips avec jpage, trouver un exemple concret 

== Add to snippets

TODO : réviser comment ça marche !

== Code templates

Cf. Java/Editor/Templates

== Extensions: SnipMatch

Example: formatter on/off (cf. <<formatterOnOff>>)

TODO : vérifier fonctionnement et besoin rezo ?

== Breakpointing

* Conditionally
* by Hit Count
* By Exception Type
* By Class Loading

image::breakpointing.jpg[]

TODO : affiner lui et la suite.

== Conditional breakpoint

Many conditions, not always well-known

<<<

Use it to debug : 

[source,java]
System.out.println("HERE WE ARE: "+theVariable);
return false;

== Clean Up

== How to quick fix many issues outside of the Clean up menu

Many quick fixes are actually available, but not always through cleanup

* Go to the Problems view
* Then call... the Quick Fix
* Select the issue you want to fix
* Click select all
