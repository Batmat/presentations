== Abreviate package name

In _Java/Appearance/abbreviate package names_ :

Example:

    net.batmat.econ2015={DEMO}

== Find any class by name

[role="shortcut tip"]
Control-Shift-T

== Browse current class methods

Ctrl-O displays all the methods of the current class

<<< 

Or Inherited

Ctrl-O-O methods of the current class + *parent*

== Find resources

[role="shortcut tip"]
Control-Shift-R

== Use CamelCase

image::camelcase-filtering.png[]

<<<

Or more selectively

image::camelcase-filtering-more-selective.png[]

Use space or < to stop matching

== Move/Copy lines up and down

:selectedtextdown: the currently selected lines down

* Alt-arrow-down to move {selectedtextdown}
* Ctrl-Alt-arrow-down to copy {selectedtextdown}

== Quick contextual execution menu

_Alt-Shift-x_ will display a contextual menu.

Example: you're in a JUnit class, just type Alt-Shift-X then T to run the tests.

image::alt-shift-x-menu.png[]

== Execute previous run instead of current open file

Be explicit. Changing the code it's natural to just run Ctrl-F11 or F11 to re-execute the previously ran test

Run/Debug/Launching/Launch Operation/Always launch the previously launched application

[[QuickFix]]
== Quick fix

Type _Ctrl-Shift-1_ to see what the possible actions are on the current focus

== Extract Method

Select text, right click and extract the whole code block into a new method easily.

== Inline Method

Contrary to the previous one, easily inline the code of a method.

* Select method to inline/Right click/Refactor/Inline Method.
* Shortcut: Alt-Shift-I

== Refactoring: Replacing ternary with if/else

Sometimes (well, more often than not, I'd argue), you should replace your ternary expression with an if[/else]

Before :

image::ternary-before.png[]

After :

image::ternary-after.png[]

== Invert if/else conditions

Select the if/else to invert, and call the <<QuickFix,Quick Fix>>

== Generate for-loop on collection

Just type the collection/array, and call the <<QuickFix,Quick Fix>>

== Typing: automatically place semicolons

== Typing: escape text when pasting into a string literal

Not enabled by default. In Java/Editor/Typing.

== Meta-Shortcut

Use _Ctrl-Shift-3_ on a selected item, then start typing to filter the possible actions in the _Quick access_ menu.

[[formatterOnOff]]
== Formatter: don't touch that part (using begin/end tags)

[source,java]
----
// @formatter:off
     // Some weirdly formatted source
     String s2 = 
				            "hello";
// @formatter:on
----

== How to quick fix many issues outside of the Clean up menu

Many quick fixes are actually available, but not always through cleanup

* Go to the Problems view
* Then call... the Quick Fix
* Select the issue you want to fix
* Click select all

== Junit: add -ea to VM arguments..

Good way to enable this option but not globally when you may be using libs that added a bunch of incorrect assertions

== Favorites

Autocomplete static imports!

In Java/Editor/Content Assist/Favorites

== JSR305 annotations to help null analysis

Lets you add more typesafe-ness in your codebase (at least way more than Javadoc does!).

<<<

Annotate the package itself to define the default value for a whole package

=> `package-info.java`

== JSR 305 externally defined annotations

New in Eclipse Mars, released yesterday! (24/03/2015).
link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/M6/#JDT[JSR305 externally annotated classes (Eclipse Mars)]

TODO TODO TODO !

== Save actions: automatic formating

Useful: be able to automatically format only the code just modified when saving the file.

See in _Java/Editor/Save Actions/Format source code/Format edited lines_

== Overwrite end of method name instead of adding

Java/Editor/Content Assist : toggle "Completion overwrites" instead of "Completion Inserts"

And can be toggled live using _Ctrl_ key.

== Instanceof Automatic Contextualization

Inside an instanceof block, analyzes the type of the given instanceof and autocompletes with its methods:

image::autocast-instanceof.png[]

== Type filters

In Java/Appearance/Type Filters

To filter out java.awt.* for example...

<<<

filter out method coming from Object! (who wants to call notify...)

== Filtering methods by categorizing them

Categorize Filtering/choosing which methods to display in the _Outline_ using javadoc's _@category_ tags

== _Exception variable name in catch blocks_

== Multi-line Edit

Alt-Shift-A or the icon, as if Sublime Text invented it all ;-)

== Breakpointing

* conditional
* exception
* class load!

TODO : affiner lui et la suite.

== Conditional breakpoints

Many conditions, not always well-known
