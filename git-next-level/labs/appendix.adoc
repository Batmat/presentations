== rebase -i basics
TIP: Most instructions below require the use of: 

[source]
git rebase -i <COMMIT SHA>

[TIP]
===
When doing an interactive rebase
footnote:[The SHA you have to use is the *excluded*Â point from where the history twiddling will start. 
That is: if the first commit you want to modify is `12eaf` then use for example simply `12eaf~` to easily refer to the previous one. 
If you just want to potentially rewrite about the 5 last commits, then you'll generally use `git rebase -i HEAD~5`.],
read what's displayed inside your editor

[source]
----
$ git rebase -i HEAD~
pick 3262d5a ...

# Rebase 0345973..76e0b82 onto 0345973
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented ou
----

Read what's above. You *can* reorder commits by just *moving lines up or down*, or removing commits by just *removing a whole line*.

In general, read what Git displays. For example, when you edit a commit, Git tells you what/how to 
do most of the things (`git rebase --continue`, etc.)
===

CAUTION: `git rebase -i` will display commits in chronological order, contrary to `git log`

== Rolling back if required

If you want to just rollback any modification you made: use `reflog`, find the previous correct `HEAD` SHA, then reset your working copy to it

    $ git reset --hard <SHA>

For example, if you want to rollback everything to the initial state, just run 

    $ git reset --hard fc30
