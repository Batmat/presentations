== Bonus Track

IMPORTANT: Do that part only if you finished everything above.

=== Filter-branch

image:../resources/shaking.png[]

NOTE: for this workshop, you need to use repository "git-next-level-workshop-filter-branch.git" (workshop resources).

IMPORTANT: filter-branch rewrites all commits of your repository. Be sure to be aware of impacts.

==== Remove file from history

A password.txt file has been commited from the beginning of the history, using filter-branch, try to completely remove this file from this history.

NOTE: you can use either `--tree-filter` or `--index-filter` options of filter-branch but the last one is recommended


==== Changing author email of each commit

Your repository is ready to be share with the open-source community, yeah ! 

But you have completely forgotten to set your personal email before committing your files...

Using filter-branch, try to change all commit to set your personal email.

NOTE: you can use either `--commit-filter` or `--env-filter` options of filter-branch.

NOTE: Git keeps track on all commit ! If you have trouble with filter-branch, you can restore the last state of your repository using `git reset --hard refs/original/refs/heads/master`


=== Garbage collect all the things

NOTE: Having a GC is very hype those days. Git has one too! Git GC will actually execute automatically under some conditions (too many loose/dangling objects, too many branches/tags...). You generally won't run it manually like in the next part.

* Execute `ls .git && ls -l .git/refs/heads` at your test repository root
* Execute `git gc --aggressive --prune=now`
* See what it changed. Explain the goal of the created file.

=== Interactive staging

[[addpatch]]
==== Through command line and `git add -p`

* Create a repository with an initial empty root commit

Execute the following:

[source]
git init interactivestaging && cd interactivestaging && git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
echo -e "Some line\nfollowed by that one, more long\n\nanother one\n\nand another, biting the dust, for one.\n" > thefiletostage
git add thefiletostage && git commit -m "File init"
echo -e "sometext before\n\n$( cat thefiletostage )and some after\n and again" > thefiletostage

Then `git diff` should show the following:

[source]
----
diff --git a/thefiletostage b/thefiletostage
index 8362737..b4fcccb 100644
--- a/thefiletostage
+++ b/thefiletostage
@@ -1,7 +1,9 @@
+sometext before
+
 Some line
 followed by that one, more long
 
 another one
 
-and another, biting the dust, for one.
-
+and another, biting the dust, for one.and some after
+ and again
----

* use `git add -p` to do *two* commits:
** one for the modification at the beginning of the file
** one for the modification at the end of the file
