NOTE: for this workshop, you need to use repository "git-next-level-workshop-bisect.git" (workshop resources).

== Find the bug !

Open index.html of your repository and click to the button. A bug has been discovered !

=== Starting bisect

Begin the bisect action with : 

[source]
git bisect start

So that Git can begin, you must declare a good and a bad commit to start the bisection : 

[source]
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <COMMIT_THAT_DOES_NOT_HAVE_THE_BUG>

After executing these two commands, Git is in `detached` mode. Your are now positioned on a commit calculated by dichotomy of the two commits specified on previous commands.

=== Declaring bad and good commits

Re-open the index.html and see if the bug is still present.

If this is the case, declare it as a bad commit : 
[source]
git bisect bad

If not, declare it as a good commit : 
[source]
git bisect good

Git automatically moves the repository state to another commit so that you can try to reproduce the bug, declare it as a bad or a good commit, and so on.

Continue previous operations until that you find the bug which has introduced the regression.

TIP: If retrieving the bug is "scriptable", you can find the bug `auto-magically` using `git bisect run <cmd>`. See `git help bisect` for details.
