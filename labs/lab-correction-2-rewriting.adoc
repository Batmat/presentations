== Rewriting

CAUTION: For this workshop, you need to use repository `git-next-level-workshop-rewriting.git` (workshop resources).

=== Playing with rebase
==== Basics
See <<rebaseInteractiveBasics>> first and along the lab if needed.

==== Let's start

* Open your shell, `cd` to the git workshop repository, list all commits.

CAUTION: Respect the steps order of the following. If you don't, you may change commit SHA-1 and not be able to find the SHA-1 given below.

. The three last commits ("Add jumbotron (partXXX)") are not consistent separately, merge these commits to create only one (and remove the useless _(partXXX)_ part of the commit log).
.. (For reference: first commit SHA-1 shortened version	 = `fc3034f86`)
. Manipulate the two following commits in the same interactive rebase :
.. Commit fe9ba27 is an inconsistent commit. Two different modifications have been made : the first adding a footer and the another correcting the header added in the precedent commit.
.. Commit 05a2231 is a correction of commit fe9ba27 (this sha1 has been changed during precedent action). Merge these two commits to create only one.
Split this commit to move header correction in the precedent commit and keep footer addition in two distinct and consistent commits.
. Commit dbb8f26 has a spelling error. Fix it.

=== Playing with dangling commit

Execute this command : 
[source]
git checkout fe9ba27

This commit has been modified during precedent actions. But you can still check it out.

* How does Git keep track of it?
* Explain why.

=== Playing with "cherry-pick"

The current repository has a branch named "header-black-experiment".
Execute : 
[source]
git checkout header-black-experiment

* List all commits.
* Using cherry-pick command, try to retrieve commit edcdd0a on the master branch
