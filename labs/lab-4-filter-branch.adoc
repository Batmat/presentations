== Filter-branch

NOTE: for this workshop, you need to use repository "git-next-level-workshop-filter-branch.git" (workshop resources).

IMPORTANT: filter-branch rewrites all commits of your repository. Be sure to be aware of impacts.

=== Remove file from history

A password.txt file has been commited from the beginning of the history, using filter-branch, try to completely remove this file from this history.

NOTE: you can use either `--tree-filter` or `--index-filter` options of filter-branch but the last one is recommended


=== Changing author email of each commit

Your repository is ready to be share with the open-source community, yeah ! 

But you have completely forgotten to set your personal email before committing your files...

Using filter-branch, try to change all commit to set your personal email.

NOTE: you can use either `--commit-filter` or `--env-filter` options of filter-branch.

NOTE: Git keeps track on all commit ! If you have trouble with filter-branch, you can restore the last state of your repository using `git reset --hard refs/original/refs/heads/master`
